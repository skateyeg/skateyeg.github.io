<a name="about"></a><h2>About</h2><h3>Mission Statement</h3>
<p>We are hoping to provide the aggressive inline community with consistent and understandable information regarding aggressive inline rollerblading.</p>
<p>There is lots of material on the internet but it is all over the place and we're hoping to tie it together in one source.</p>
<p>We are aiming to educate new, and existing, rollerbladers and expose this sports complexity.</p>
<p>Aggressive inline deserves to be widely recognized and brought back to it's glory days so spread the word and get people hooked!</p>
<p>If we manage to inspire at least one person out there then this project is a success!</p>
<p>Through the progression of this project and our personal development we are hoping to tailor the material for anyone who is willing to teach others about Aggressive Inline. If you can use the material to teach other people, please do so. We would greatly appreciate if you could reference our website and our project if you use our material (technically and legally you must due to the CC BY-NC-SA License).</p>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
<p>This is a 100% voluntary, non-profit project. The content is "as is", meaning that if you like it use it, if you don't like it don't use it.</p>
<p>We do our best to bring the most valid and applicable information.</p>
<p>This material is intended for research purposes and it is up to you to determine its validity.</p>
<p>We are by no means claiming that this website contains all the information that's out there, and that we have covered every angle of every grind. We are trying to list and explain the basic, and more advanced stuff, but there is always more to do! Get creative.</p>
<p>Know your own skill level, be safe, and wear protective gear.</p>
<p>We take absolutely no responsibility for what you do with/how you use the information contained within this website and/or any other material associated with this website and its content.</p>
<p>Vocabulary and trick names may (and in some cases do) vary across the globe (i.e. our Planet Earth) as well as through different generations of skaters. We're fully aware of that, and our content is an effort to normalize some of these differences. There really is no right or wrong answers here, unless of course they're really really wrong.</p>

<p>If you copy or use the material you must always keep it free and licensed under the same CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.</p>

<h3>Versioning</h3>
<p>Versioning of the website is provided because the creator of the scripts is a coding geek.</p>
<p>It is also there for your reference to check if the website has been updated since the last time you checked (so remember the number if this is something you’re interested in).</p>
<p>The format of versioning is "a.b.c D" where:</p>
<p>a = major version release (i.e. huge overhaul or something very new or different)</p>
<p>b = minor version release (i.e. some template changes, bug fixes, script related stuff)</p>
<p>c = minor build version (i.e. new grinds, spelling fixes, small visual or contextual changes – this number will increase most rapidly)</p>
<p>D = version description (i.e. BETA, or Final release, Special release, or whatever the creator comes up with)</p>
<p>We are not keeping a log, or version history.</p><a name="contact"></a><h2>Contact</h2><p>Follow the official Facebook page at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/bookofgrinds/">facebook.com/bookofgrinds/</a> for updates, comments, and discussion.</p>

<p>The project, initially, was to become a website for general skatepark information for the Edmonton Area with inclusion of sections for all sorts of action sports. It quickly became evident that this project was way too large for one person to accomplish and it sat dormant for a while, with the domain registered already and a couple initial versions of websites built. Edmonton is identified by the YEG airport code which is commonly used on social media as YEG... something... to tag things that are happening in the city. Skate, well, because of skateparks. It nicely translated to the rollerblading project we are working on so the domain remained as is (we do own http://bookofgrinds.com as well but are staying with the original domain as the primary).</p>

<h3>Why is this content free?</h3>
<p>The Director of this project believes in free education, and that information should be available to public at no cost for growth and learning - no matter if you have the money to consume it, or not. We also want to promote rollerblading and give people material they can use to explore and learn the sport from a consistent source. Any income from donations or other support that we generate from this project is directly invested to cover online maintenance fees and support our <a href="http://jrbladers.skateyeg.com">Junior Bladers Skate Team Program</a> in Edmonton, AB - Canada.</p>

<h3>Will there be a video game?</h3>
<p>Wouldn't that be something?! Video games are a huge undertaking. We would love to have a video game of some sort out, one day. But can't really say for sure if it will ever happen.</p>

<h3>Will there be different language options?</h3>
<p>Eventually, yes. This will require proper translations of each page and it's content. In meantime you may try using Google Translate (a free translator) to look up the content - it might not be perfect but it's better than nothing.</p>

<h3>Will there be right leg dominant grind previews?</h3>
<p>It is very time consuming to create the grinds "the other way" so for consistency we are using left leg dominant previews. There is no immediate plan to create previews for right leg dominant grinds however you may find one or two that are shown with the right leg as the primary leg.</p>

<h3>Website References</h3>
<p>We found this old page and used some of it to look up information (it explains lots of other things that are not addressed on this website as well) <a href="http://toxboe.net/all/1997-aggressive-inline-skating-dictionary">toxboe.net/all/1997-aggressive-inline-skating-dictionary</a></p>
<h3>Other References</h3>
<p>Google search and YouTube are your friends, you can try looking up specific grinds and you will most likely find something. There is too much material out there to list it all here, so happy searching!</p>
