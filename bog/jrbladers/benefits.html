</ul>

<h2>Mental Benefits</h2>

	<li>Conquer fear and pushing boundaries of ones' own limits while learning how to use obstacles, jumping on and off of objects.</li>
	<li>Promote higher level of thinking while planning and debating movements, assessing risk of performing actions, and exploring consequences of these actions.</li>

</ul>
	
<h2>Physical Benefits</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Muscle strength including many different muscle groups.</li>
	<li>Physical balance i.e. the act of balancing.</li>
	<li>Exercise that's beyond team sports, or fitness rollerblading.</li>	
	<li>Elevated levels of stamina.</li>
	<li>Muscle consistency and flow of muscle movement (smoothness).</li>
	<li>It's like a martial art, but on wheels.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social Benefits</h2>

	<li>We work as a team to achieve common or personal goals.</li>
	<li>Children benefit from a sense of belonging.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Benefits</h2>

	<li>Confidence that is transferrable between different sports and life in general.</li>

	<li>There is a variety of competitive skatepark and street skate events to attend! There are some locally, and many more internationally.</li>
	<li>Life long friendships are built no matter on where people end up working, where they end up living.</li>
	<li>Potential for future sponsor deals and exposure to a large international industry.</li>
	<li>A common activity among adult (or sometimes younger) aggressive bladers is traveling the world to skate events with people who care for and look out for one another.</li>
