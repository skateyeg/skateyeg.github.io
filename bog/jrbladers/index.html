<p>Welcome to the home page of Junior Bladers - Kids Aggressive Inline Team Program <!--(Established November 2019)--></p></div>
<p>Currently the Junior Bladers program is undergoing restructure.</p>
<p>We ran the pilot program successfully, but due to COVID-19 interruptions the program was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Check back for updates.</p>
<p>Currently we have local members of Shredmonton Inline Skating Association (<a href="https://shredmonton.ca/">shredmonton.ca/</a>) certified as SkateIA instructors (<a href="https://skateia.org/">skateia.org</a>). More details regarding this will be posted in the future.</p>
<!--<img src="images/JBBladers_GroupNov2019.JPG" alt="Junior Bladers Group Picture - November 2019"/>						
<h2>Instructor Experience</h2>
<p>We teach kids how to skate through personal experience and teaching our own children. We are currently also in the process of acquiring certification through SkateIA (<a href="https://skateia.org/">skateia.org</a>).</p>
<h2>Program Summary</h2>
<p>Junior Bladers is free to join (with exceptions to facility entry fees). Please see the requirements in the <a href="signup.html">Sign Up</a> section.</p>
<p>Please be aware that at this stage we require children to have their own equipment (especially rollerblades) but we are working on some different solutions.</p>
<p>Any time is a good time to join! Although we have some scheduled activities there is no beginning or end to the program, it is a continuous thing.</p>
<p>The main focus of this program is Aggressive Inline and Skate Park use.</p>
<p>For more in-depth information check the <a href="benefits.html">Benefits</a> section to read about some core concepts children will learn through this program, and also check the <a href="structure.html">Structure</a> section to read about what our typical programming looks like.</p>
<p>This program is sponsored by <a href="bog/">Aggressive Inline - Book of Grinds</a>, and is supported by <a href="https://shredmonton.ca">Shredmonton Inline Skating Association</a>.</p>			
<h2>Who are Junior Bladers?</h2>
<p>The average age of the kids on the team is 9 years old, with the oldest currently being 11 and youngest 5 - including boys and girls.</p>
<p>Our kids are from Edmonton and surrounding areas.</p>			

<h2>What is Aggressive Inline?</h2>
<p>Aggressive Inline is a sub-category of rollerblading. It its an area where rollerblades perform tricks at skateparks (or streets; however, our program focuses mainly on skateparks). Tricks include grinding (sliding on) elements, 
jumping over obstacles, and things of that nature. It is a specialized sub-category that has it's own culture and it's own unique set of skills and requirements.</p>

<h2>What if my Child is Not Into Skate-Parks?</h2>
<p>You can check out Alien Inline, who provide rollerblading instructions, and are present at schools around Alberta and British Columbia - Canada.</p>
