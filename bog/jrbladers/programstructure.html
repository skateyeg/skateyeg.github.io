			<h1>Program Structure</h1>
<h2>Basic Program Outline</h2>
<p>Currently the Junior Bladers program is undergoing restructure.</p>
<p>We ran the pilot program successfully, but due to COVID-19 interruptions the program was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Check back for updates.</p>
<!--
<ul>
	<li>Many parents are rollerbladers who attend the sessions and skate with the kids.</li>
	<li>We are working on Skate Instructor Certifications through <a href="https://skateia.org/">SkateIA</a>, details will be posted.</li>
	<li>We have guest rollerbladers, who join the sessions and happily share their knowledge and experience.</li>
	<li>We work as a team and help one another throughout the sessions.</li>
	<li>We establish common goals and work together to reach them.</li>
	<li>We give kids the choice of freedom to express themselves through making choices about how they want to skate.</li>
	<li>We provide rollerblading research assignments for kids to learn about equipment and culture.</li>
	<li>We teach kids skate park etiquette, responsibility, and safety.</li>
	<li>Information regarding any activities, schedules, and team related updates is E-Mailed to parents as a group so you can stay up to date on what's happening.</li>
	<li>Kids 13 years or younger require an adult to be present (legal parent/guardian).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Program Schedule</h2>
<p>We meet every Saturday Morning for 2 hours (generally at 10AM) unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>Our sessions consist of:
	<ul>
		<li>10-15 minutes getting ready and individual warmup</li>
		<li>10-15 minutes group stretching and discussion</li>
		<li>Remainder of session is free skate time where kids have an opportunity to break into groups (generally they do, and rotate who they're skating with). We give them the freedom of skating what they like and how they like, while observing, giving them hints and tips about what they are doing, and encouraging them to take things to the next level.</li>		
	</ul>
</p>
<h3>Bad Weather</h3>
<p>We are blessed to have a facility in our city that supports "all-wheel" action sports.</p>
<p>Our 2hr winter, and bad weather, sessions are at <a href="https://houseofwheels.ca/">House of Wheels (houseofwheels.ca)</a>. Please be aware entry fees apply, and facility waivers must be signed. Go to their website for more information.</p>
<h3>Good Weather</h3>
<p>We are also blessed with many outdoor skate parks in and around the city, and beyond.</p>
<p>Our 2hr+ summer, and good weather, sessions are at randomly selected outdoor skate parks (information is emailed ahead of time for locations and meeting times). We rotate through different locations to expose our Junior Bladers to different types of elements so they can continuously progress and learn new things. Of course in case of bad weather we use our <b>Bad Weather</b> backup.</p>
<h3>Special Events/Sessions</h3>
<p>Inclusive to our programming we have the following:
	<ul>
		<li>Birthday Month Sessions - last session of the month celebrating the current month's birthdays with just a little of extra cheer to the birthday kids!</li>
		<li>Field Trips - scheduled trips to skate parks outside of our regular programming (i.e. Red Deer, Calgary, etc.).<br/><i>Field Trip fees may apply.</i></li>
		<li>Inline Competitions - currently <a href="https://shredmonton.ca/">Shredmonton Inline Skating Association</a> is hosting an Inline Summer Skate Series that the kids have a chance to participate in.<br/><i>Competition fees may apply.</i></li>
		<li>Other - throughout the year we may have different types of extra events (depending on funding, and participation).</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h2>Can Kids Use Different Equipment?</h2>
<p>The short answer is <b>no</b>.</p>
<p>Most of our children do use different equipment on their free time (BMX, Scooters, Skateboards, etc.) but during our programming they need to be on rollerblades. What they do after our 2hr sessions is entirely up to them.</p>
<p>Pretty well most Inline Skates are acceptable to be used during our sessions and we can find something to do no matter what the kids are skating. Inline Skates are defined as having 2 or more wheels in-line (i.e. not quad skates, not 1 wheel in the front, 2 wheels in the back etc.)</p>-->
